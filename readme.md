# Q U I N T E R

This discord bot was created during the bot competition hosted by the [Dev Sky Discord Server](https://discord.gg/devsky).
The contest ran for 2 weeks. We were given 3 possible features every 2 days and hat to implement one of the features within 84 hours.

You can add it using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1177620658247716976&permissions=395137117248&scope=bot) but no promises about uptime and availability.
Make sure to set up proper permissions, eg. disabling the /flaggame, /numbergame and /rating commands for default users.
